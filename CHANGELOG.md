# Jan. 24, 2025 - Beta 1.33

# Apr. 21, 2024 - Beta 1.23

- MASSIVE ANNOUNCEMENT: REMOVED 60 TEAMS AND CHAOS MODE GAMEMODES. Sorry to anyone who for whatever reason enjoyed these, unfortunately they just don't have much of a place in the game and it is difficult for me to manage four different servers especially when Hell Mode is the one I work on 99% of the time. Gimmicks of the removed modes may be moved into Boss Playground in the near future.
- Repeller shockwaves now can only hit enemies that are small/weak/light.

- Added Class 33.
- Added Class 34.
- Increased the base Penetration stat back up to 1.05.

- Slightly nerfed the speed of Class 1's clones.

# Apr. 2, 2024 - Beta 1.13

- Implemented tank swapping in Hell Mode. This mechanic has minor restrictions as some tanks have far less immediate swapping options than others, and some have none. Simply click 'Ignore' to get rid of the upgrade menu, and you can go back to Tri-Angle by pressing the ` key. (top left, under '~'). If you are using a tank with no swapping options, you will not have the ability to switch back to Tri-Angle.
- Changed the name input and changelog text to more easily readable fonts.
- Reworked 'ylovrgenedkushaernzaum' so that you now have to charge up your thruster cannons before they actually fire, at which point you will get a relatively short burst of thruster bullets before having to charge again. Its front bullet now does moderate damage.
- Reordered upgrades to emphasize more useful tanks.
- Removed  .
- Decreased the amount of Class 3s to spawn in its wave. (30 -> 9)

# Mar. 26, 2024 - Beta 1.10

- Changed the ingame font, slightly edited the death screen and recolored the skill stats.

# Mar. 25, 2024 - Beta 1.09

- (Announcement) The game is now hosted on Surge!! This should improve many things including overall performance.
- You now spawn in as a fully leveled-up tank, so it's no longer necessary to press 'N'. Note that this change only applies to Hell Mode, so the 'Auto-Level Up' option is not useless.
- Added 2 new tanks! One of these is called the Diversionist and can use its side bullets to distract enemies. The other is quite slow compared to others but has high DPS, which will be useful in most enemy encounters.
- Changed the messages that appear at the top of the screen when you spawn in.
